On Linux my games were very visibly locked to 60fps even if it said it was higher and vsync was off.
This is becuase my second monitor is 60Hz, my main is 165Hz.

Tutorial changed to fit my needs taken from: https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware/comments/mht7kn/workaround_for_multiple_monitors_with_different/

Make sure latest nvidia drivers are installed.
Go into nvidia-settings
	X-Server display Config
	-> Advanced
		-> Force Full Composite Pipeline
		(Do on both monitors)
	
	OpenGL settings
	-> Sync to VBlank = OFF
	-> Allow Flipping = OFF

Saving config can be quite troublsome. Might have to copy the config manually instead of letting
nvidia-settings do it. Its the directory it tries to save to.

Have to make sure to run nvidia-settings on every startup to load config:
-----
#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/nvidia-settings --load-config-only
-----




Put this into: 
/etc/environment
-----
CLUTTER_DEFAULT_FPS=<highest_refresh_rate>
__GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE=<display_with_highest_refresh_rate>
__GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK=0
-----
Display name can be seen in nvidia-settings. Itll probably be dp-0.



On every steam game these are the launch options to use:
-----
__GL_`SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE=DP-0, __GL_VRR_ALLOWED=1
